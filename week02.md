# Week 2

I honestly couldn't tell you what we learned this week... It probably had something to do with Python, but ever since we started our group project on Thursday this week has been a blur.
Not that it hasn't been fun! It's been an extremely pleasant experience and I feel like my Python skills have only improved since we started. We hit the ground running on Thursday (or Erin did,
she was already coding the classes for our game the second we decided on what we were going to do) and I'm so proud of our team! I couldn't have asked for a better group of people and I look forward
to working with them again in the future. We've spent the last few days (I'm writing this at 12:30AM Monday morning ^^;) working on it so I hope everyone likes it :)
